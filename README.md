# Airbnb-Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, involving tasks such as data cleaning, preparation, and developing interactive geospatial visualizations. The ultimate goal is to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends within the Airbnb dataset. The project covers a range of skills, including MongoDB Atlas proficiency, Streamlit web application development, Python data analysis using Pandas and NumPy, geospatial analysis with GeoPandas or Folium, and dashboard creation using Tableau or Power BI.

## Project Structure

1. **MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval**
   - Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
   - Perform queries and data retrieval operations for efficient analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and transform data types for accurate analysis.
   - Prepare the dataset for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization tasks.

3. **Geospatial Visualization (Streamlit Web Application)**
   - Develop a Streamlit web application for interactive maps showcasing the distribution of Airbnb listings.
   - Allow users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors across different locations.

4. **Price Analysis and Visualization**
   - Analyze and visualize price variations based on location, property type, and seasons.
   - Create dynamic plots and charts for exploring price trends, outliers, and correlations.

5. **Availability Analysis by Season**
   - Analyze availability patterns, visualizing occupancy rates and demand fluctuations throughout the year.
   - Use line charts, heatmaps, or other suitable visualizations for comprehensive insights.

6. **Location-Based Insights**
   - Investigate location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods.
   - Utilize MongoDB queries and data aggregation techniques for targeted information retrieval.

7. **Interactive Visualizations**
   - Develop dynamic and interactive visualizations allowing users to filter and drill down into the data.
   - Enable users to interact with visualizations based on preferences for specific regions, property types, or time periods.

8. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Utilize Tableau or Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard presenting key insights from the analysis.
   - Combine different visualizations (maps, charts, tables) for a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset.

## Learning Outcomes

3. **Python Data Analysis**
   - Utilize Python, Pandas, and NumPy for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization tasks.

4. **Geospatial Analysis**
   - Leverage geospatial libraries like GeoPandas or Folium for analyzing and visualizing spatial patterns.

5. **Tableau or Power BI**
   - Create interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI, refining data visualization and dashboard creation skills.

6. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Develop proficiency in cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis, ensuring data quality and consistency.

7. **Data Visualization Techniques**
   - Master data visualization techniques to effectively communicate insights through charts, maps, and plots.

8. **Problem-Solving Skills**
   - Apply analytical skills to analyze pricing dynamics, availability patterns, and other factors, developing problem-solving abilities.

9. **Data-Driven Decision Making**
   - Enhance decision-making skills by enabling stakeholders to make informed choices based on project insights.

10. **Collaboration and Project Management**
    - Strengthen collaboration and project management skills through end-to-end project development.
